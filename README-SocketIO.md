# 🔌 Socket.IO Real-time Learning with Node.js

Welcome to my personal learning repository for **Socket.IO**, where I’ve documented everything I learned while building real-time features using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**.

The goal of this repo is to **understand real-time communication** — how servers and clients can talk to each other instantly without needing to refresh or pull data manually.

---

## ✅ What is Socket.IO?

> **Socket.IO** is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between the browser and the server. It uses WebSockets under the hood and falls back to HTTP long polling when WebSockets aren’t available.

Use-cases:
- Chat apps 🗨️  
- Live notifications 🔔  
- Multiplayer games 🎮  
- Collaborative apps (like Google Docs) 📝  

---

## ⚙️ How it Works (Simple Terms)

When a user opens the frontend:
1. A **WebSocket connection** is created between client and server.
2. That connection stays open until the user leaves or disconnects.
3. You can now emit custom events like `chat message`, `user typing`, `user joined`, etc.

## 🚀 How to Run this Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Official-CIPHER/Socket-io-Learning.git
cd Socket-io-Learning
npm install
node server.js
```

Now open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## 💡 Key Concepts with Examples

### 1. 🔗 Socket Connection

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("User connected with ID:", socket.id);
});
```

📌 `socket.id` is a unique identifier for each connected user.

---

### 2. 📤 Emitting Events (Client → Server)

```js
// frontend (app.jsx)
socket.emit("sendMessage", "Hello Server!");
```

```js
// backend (app.js)
socket.on("sendMessage", (msg) => {
  console.log("Received message from client:", msg);
});
```

---

### 3. 📥 Emitting Events (Server → Client)

```js
socket.emit("serverReply", "Hey client, I got your message!");
```

```js
io.emit("broadcastMessage", "Hello everyone!");
```

---

### 4. 📢 Broadcasting

```js
socket.broadcast.emit("userJoined", `${socket.id} joined the chat`);
```

---

### 5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Rooms

```js
socket.join("room1");
io.to("room1").emit("roomMessage", "User joined Room 1");
socket.leave("room1");
```

---

### 6. 📛 Namespaces

```js
const adminNamespace = io.of("/admin");
adminNamespace.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("Admin connected:", socket.id);
});

// client
const socket = io("/admin");
```

---

### 7. 🔍 Tracking All Socket IDs (Except Self)

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  const allSockets = Array.from(io.sockets.sockets.keys());
  const others = allSockets.filter((id) => id !== socket.id);
  socket.emit("allUsers", others);
});
```

---

### 8. ✨ Real-time Chat Example

**Client (Frontend)**

```html
<input id="msgInput" />
<button onclick="send()">Send</button>

<script>
  const socket = io();
  function send() {
    const msg = document.getElementById("msgInput").value;
    socket.emit("chatMessage", msg);
  }
  socket.on("chatMessage", (msg) => {
    console.log("New Message:", msg);
  });
</script>
```

**Server (Backend)**

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("chatMessage", (msg) => {
    io.emit("chatMessage", msg); // send to everyone
  });
});
```

---

## 📊 Understanding emit vs broadcast vs io.emit

| Method | Who receives it? | Sender included? |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| `socket.emit` | Only the sender | ✅ |
| `socket.broadcast.emit` | Everyone else | ❌ |
| `io.emit` | Everyone | ✅ |
| `io.to('room')` | Only users in the room | Depends |
